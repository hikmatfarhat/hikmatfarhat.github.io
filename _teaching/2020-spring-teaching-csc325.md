The **course material** can be found [here](https://hikmatfarhat-ndu/CSC325).
**Short description**: This is the standard algorithm course where the student is introduced to
thedifferent algorithm design paradigms: divide-and-conquer, greedy and dynamic programming.
Network flows and applications are covered as well. In addition NP compleness is introduced from
the theoretical, e.g. reductions, and practical perspective. Different methods for dealing with
NP complete problems such as backtracking, branch and bound and using SAT solvers are covered.
