**Short description**: This is a four day workshop on Neural Networks funded by DAAD(germany).
It start by developing Neural Networks from scratch in Python with a view of what is "under the hood" including backpropagation. After that the students are introduced to Tensorflow/Keras and all the applications are done with that framework. Topics include: Convolution Networks, Recurrent Networks, Generative Adversarial Networks, Autoencoders including Variational Autoencoders.
