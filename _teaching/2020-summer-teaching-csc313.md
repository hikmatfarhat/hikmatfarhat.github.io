The **course material** can be found [here](https://hikmatfarhat-ndu.github.io/CSC313).
**Short Description:** This course provides a detailed coverage of standard data structures 
with an emphasis on complexity analysis. Topics include: Asymptotic analysis, vectors, linked
lists, stacks, queues,trees and balanced trees, hashing, priority queues and heaps, sorting. Standard graph algorithms such as DFS, BFS, shortest paths and minimum spanning trees are also covered.
We will be making heavy use of C++ so it is important you read the c++ review early before the course really takes off.
